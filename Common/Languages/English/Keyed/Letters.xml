	<Lethe_Letter_IsoDataChipDesc>While tidying the research bench, one of your colonists stumbled upon a mysterious object that they initially thought was a shard of broken glass.\n\nCloser examination reveals highly intricate and precise circuit-like patterns embedded within the transparent material, and what appears to be interface terminals compatible with contemporary computing systems.\n\nThe colonist who first found it immediately recognized the significance of the find, recalling stories shared by passing traders of an ancient civilization renowned for their advanced optical computing technology. Initial analysis suggests that the artifact may indeed be an optical datachip, possibly holding untold knowledge or advanced research data.\n\nIf you construct a {0} and complete the {1} research project, perhaps you could reveal its contents.</Lethe_Letter_IsoDataChipDesc>
